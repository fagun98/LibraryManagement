# LibraryManagement
The primary objective of this particular project is to develop a library management system that utilizes the principles of inheritance and object-oriented programming, while adhering to the SOLID design principles. By leveraging these fundamental concepts, we can ensure that our code is modular, extensible, and maintainable.

This library management system offers two distinct types of membership options, each tailored to meet the unique needs of our users. Additionally, it provides an efficient and user-friendly book search functionality, enabling individuals to search for books using either the author's name or the book's title.

Overall, this project seeks to build a highly functional and efficient library management system, leveraging the principles of object-oriented programming and SOLID design to deliver an exceptional user experience.
